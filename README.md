This EDA analysis was based on the Kaggle dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/chtpd

The code was written in a Jupyter notebook running python 3.6 and libraries: scipy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn

I thought this dataset was interesting for a couple of reasons, it deals with hot topics such as crime and policing.  I know nothing about Cheltenham accept through this dataset and I thought it would be interesting to learn about the area via the crime statistics.  I also thought it would be interesting to visual ‘test’ anecdotal theories (I’ll spare you the voodoo) about crime and how it relates to days of the week and time.

Rather than go through here the choice of factors for EDA, I just let my fingers explore the set and explode values and charts where I thought something looked interesting.  I hope you find the information illuminating as I have.

Further I plan to work with the set a bit more and incorporate some quantitative models to see if there is some predictability.
